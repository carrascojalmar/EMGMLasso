### Abstract
High-dimensional data are now routinely analyzed, typically with many more covariates than observations, and are often solved using computationally expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques or very complicated optimization algorithms. An alternative method for regularizing select variables is the Lasso, widely applied to generalized linear models, where fast and efficient methods based on the descent gradient algorithm are available. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and the popular Lasso for variable selection of fixed effects in Bernoulli generalized linear mixed effects models under probit and logit links. We conduct extensive simulation studies to show the computational advantage of our method compared with alternative approaches available in the literature for responses binary and its power to identify significant predictors. The application shows the performance of the procedure proposal to handle predictors of different types and cumulative noise.
